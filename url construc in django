How Django works:

the URL request from the user is handle in projectname/urls.py
    
    from django.conf.urls import include, url
    from django.contrib import admin

    urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),  
    url(r'^newapp/', include('newapp.urls')),

  We can see that the url site.com/admin is redirected to the module admin of django
  the second line will link the url site.com/newapp/.. + etc. to the a specific url administration file located in newapp/urls.py
  
  So in the file newapp/urls.y : 
      
        from django.conf.urls import url
        from . import views     #we import the file views located in the same directory
        
        urlpatterns = [
                        url(r'^$', views.home, name='home_url_name'),
                         ]
this asign the URL site.com/newapp/ to the view home. The url has a name :"home"


So the file view is 

            from django.shortcuts import render
