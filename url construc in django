How Django works:

the URL request from the user is handle in projectname/urls.py
    

    from django.conf.urls import include, url
    from django.contrib import admin

    urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),  
    url(r'^newapp/', include('newapp.urls')),
  We can see that the url site.com/admin is redirected to the module admin of django
  the second line will link the url site.com/newapp/.. + etc. to the a specific url administration file located in newapp/urls.py
    this the manner clean to do it
  
  So in the file newapp/urls.y : 
      
        from django.conf.urls import url
        from . import views     #we import the file views located in the same directory
        
        urlpatterns = [
                        url(r'^$', views.home, name='home_url_name'),
                         ]
this asign the URL site.com/newapp/ to the view named home. The url has a name :"home"


So the file view is 

            from django.shortcuts import render
            def home(request):
            return render(request, 'newapp/home.html', {})
     this file will load the file home.html 
     
     
     What will be more usefull in the file  views:
     
            from django.shortcuts import render
            from django.utils import timezone
            from .models import Post

            def variable_list'posts': posts}(request):
            variable = ClassModelInNewapp.objects.filter('filter fonction')
            return render(request, 'blog/post_list.html', {'variable': variable})
     this will send variable from our models into the html construction
     
     
     bad idea:
     
     urlpatterns = patterns('',
url(r'^accueil/$', 'blog.views.home'),
url(r'^truc/$', 'blog.views.truc'),
url(r'^chose/$', 'blog.views.chose'),
url(r'^machin/$', 'blog.views.machin'),
url(r'^foo/$', 'blog.views.foo'),
url(r'^bar/$', 'blog.views.bar'),
)

good idea:

urlpatterns = patterns('blog.views',
url(r'^accueil/$', 'home'),
url(r'^truc/$', 'truc'),
url(r'^chose/$', 'chose'),
url(r'^machin/$', 'machin'),
url(r'^foo/$', 'foo'),
url(r'^bar/$', 'bar'),
)
